# UK Crime Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes UK crime data using PySpark, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels, and scikit-learn. The analysis focuses on identifying crime trends, detecting anomalies, and predicting future crime patterns, particularly considering the impact of COVID-19.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* PySpark
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* statsmodels
* scikit-learn
* NumPy

## Results
The analysis delivers various plots and output analysis results, including:
        * Time series plots of crime trends.
        * Correlation matrix heatmap.
        * Silhouette score plot for K-Means clustering.
        * Anomaly detection plots.
        * SARIMA model diagnostics.
        * Crime trend forecasts.

## Key Findings

* The analysis identifies trends in serious crime cases, showing seasonal patterns.
* Correlations between different crime types are visualized, indicating potential associations.
* Anomalies in crime patterns are detected using K-Means clustering, highlighting significant deviations from typical trends, especially during the Covid 19 pandemic.
* Time series forecasting using SARIMA models provides insights into potential future crime trends.
